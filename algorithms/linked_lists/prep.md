## Week 1, Thursday 2/23 Prep

- Prelude: Only the basic section is really expected, but feel free to go onto to try harder things!
- Skim through the Introduction chapter of CTC (Cracking the Coding Interview)
- However, highly recommend to read through Introduction - Technical Questions (pgs 60-81)
- DON'T READ LINKED LIST CHAPTER IN CRACKING THE CODE, at least, NOT YET.  It explains right away how to write a LinkedList, so instead I recommend you hop over to [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io/exercises/ruby/simple-linked-list/readme) instructions and a Ruby test suite provided OR [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/linked_lists_algorithm.htm), basic rundown of LinkedList provided (although only look at the pseudocode if you have to!!)
- Note: there are a couple of different ways to solve a linked list


Basic (Look at above links, or find some Youtube videos):
- write a basic linked list where you can push (insert value at back), pop (remove value at back), get the value from the front item, get value of the end item, shift (remove value at front), unshift (insert value at front)
- understand what LIFO means (last in first out) and be able to draw it
- convert an array to a LinkedList

Not as basic:
- insert specific node in the LinkedList
- delete specifc node from the LinkedList (CTC, pg 93)
- delete node with a specific value
- reverse the list


Really Not Basic (go back to Cracking the Code):
- Return Kth from the Last (CTC Chapter 2, #2.2)
- How do you tell if a LinkedList is circular or has an end?
- Most of the problems in CTC


Further reading:
- [good specs on what a LinkedList should do from Google Univeristy dude](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university#linked-lists)
- [some ruby book chapter I found](http://www.brpreiss.com/books/opus8/html/page96.html)
- [some really indepth C Stanford stuff that goes into pointers and memory of linkedlists](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/103/LinkedListBasics.pdf)
