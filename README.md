# dbc-algorithms
Welcome!  This is the repo of the DBC Algorithms Study Group.  This is a rather slap-dashed repo, so take from it or give to it what you will!


### Contribution/Submission Guidelines

None of this forking stuff!  Want to be a collaborator?  Join the FB group and ping Hanah Yendler with your Github username!

If you want to create an exercise, interview question, or solution, check out a new branch off of master, do yo thang, and then submit a pull request and get TWO approvals from other collaborators.  

Adding a new exercise?  Totally okay to post from elsewhere, just make sure to credit the source in the readme!  Exercise instructions should also be language free.

Note: You can't push to master, except for me (Hanah, repo owner) Mwuahahahaha.  So you gotta check out a branch to get your changes in.

Have a partial algorithm solution, but are stuck and don't want to look at the answer just yet?  Submit a pull request, tag a couple of co-conspirators, and ask for help! Edit, commit, and repush and explicity ask for review for a merge :)

Please only merge working solution code.  K thx bai.


### Directory organizational guidelines
- let's use underscores instead of spaces
- let's use lowercase instead of uppercase (good practice in general, as uppercase file/folder names can eff some file path shit up)
- let's have every exercise have a solutions and test folder
- let's have your solution file be yourInitials_solution.codeExtension
- write in whatever language you want (then maybe write a test in that language if it doesn't exist :P)


### Housekeeping
I can't manage this by myself, so I need your help to make this repo AWESOME. Also, TDD!  Write tests for the exercises.

Have a guideline that should be on here? Make a pull request and tag @hyendler!
